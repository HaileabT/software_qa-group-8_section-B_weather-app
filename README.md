# What we learned

Mocking, spying, and event simulation are essential techniques that significantly enhance UI testing in web applications, ensuring components and the overall application behave correctly in real-world scenarios. Mocking isolates component logic by replacing real external modules and API responses, such as with `fetch`, with controlled, simulated versions, allowing testers to validate how the UI updates in response to various outcomes like success, failure, or errors. This also enables tests to run in isolation and at scale, improving efficiency. Spying provides detailed introspection using tools like `jest.spyOn`, allowing verification that critical internal functions were invoked correctly without altering their actual behavior. Furthermore, event simulation mimics user interactions—such as clicking buttons or entering text via `fireEvent` and `waitFor`—confirming that the UI updates accordingly and that features handle input validation or network errors gracefully. <br>
Collectively, these advanced testing methods bridge the gap between application logic and user experience, ensuring features work as intended when users interact with the app, which is crucial for long-term application health. They make it easier to catch regressions, verify component integration, and establish confidence in deploying code to production, ultimately supporting collaboration and simplifying debugging.
